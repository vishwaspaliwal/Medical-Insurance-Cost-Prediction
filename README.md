# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

## Overview
This is a machine learning project that predicts medical insurance costs based on various factors such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and more. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can help individuals and insurance providers estimate potential insurance costs.

## Data
The dataset used for this project can be found in the [data](data/) directory. It contains information on policyholders, including attributes like age, sex, BMI, smoking status, region, and medical insurance costs.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-insurance-cost-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd medical-insurance-cost-prediction`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
- You can train and evaluate the predictive model by running the Jupyter notebook [Medical_Insurance_Cost_Prediction.ipynb](Medical_Insurance_Cost_Prediction.ipynb).
- Modify the notebook to experiment with different algorithms, features, and hyperparameters.
- Use the trained model to predict medical insurance costs for new data.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Model development and evaluation.
- Visualizations to understand the relationships between variables.
- Jupyter notebook for interactive exploration and experimentation.

## Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated based on standard regression metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score. The model's performance is discussed in the Jupyter notebook.
